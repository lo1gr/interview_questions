GE has invented a newlight bulb that never burns out. It could burn for more than 500 years and never blink. The director of marketing
calls you into her office and asks, “Howwould you price this?”What do you tell her?


Let me make sure I understand. GE has invented a light bulb that never burns out, and the marketing director wants us to help her
decide on a price.
– That’s correct.
Is coming up with a price the only objective? Or is there something else I should be concerned about?
– Pricing is the only objective.
Is there any competition for this product, and do we have a patent?
– We have a patent pending, and there is no other competition.
We know that the advantage is that this bulb never burns out. Are there any disadvantages to this product? Does it use the same
amount of electricity?
– There are no disadvantages, except maybe price. And that’s why you’re here. What did you spend on R&D?
– It cost $20 million to develop this product.
What are the costs associated with a conventional light bulb?
– It costs us five cents to manufacture. We sell it to the distributor for a quarter, the distributor sells it to the store for 50 cents and the store sells
it to the consumer for 75 cents.
And what does it cost us to manufacture the new light bulb?
– Five dollars.
So, if we use the conventional bulb-pricing model, that would mean the consumer would have to pay $75 for this light bulb. If we use
another simple model and say that a light bulb lasts one year and people will have this new bulb for 50 years, that’s an argument for a
retail price of $37.50 (50 years x $0.75). Then we need to ask ourselves whether a consumer would pay $37.50 for a light bulb that
never wears out. Now we’re looking at price-based costing. What are people willing to pay? And is it enough to cover our costs and
give us a nice profit?
The other main issue is that the more successful we are, the less successful we’ll be in the future. For every eternal light bulb we sell,
that’s 50 or 75 conventional bulbs we won’t sell in the future. In a sense, we’re cannibalizing our future markets. So, we have to make
sure that there is enough of a margin or profit to cover us way into the future.
– Good point.
I’ll tell you, I have reservations about selling to the consumer market. I just don’t think the opportunity for pricing is there.
– So, what do we do, scrap the project? We’ve already spent over $20 million in R&D.
Not at all. We turn to the industrial market. For example, the City of Cambridge probably has 2,000 street lamps. Those bulbs cost
maybe $20 and have to be changed twice a year. The real expense there isn’t the cost of the bulb; it’s the labor. It might take two
union workers. In addition, you have to send out a truck. It probably costs the city $150 in labor costs just to change the light bulb.
Now, if we were to sell them this ever-lasting bulb for $400, they would make that money back in less than two years and we would
make a handsome profit.
– Not bad.
